    Penelope was made around 2017. Back then she was a living child snowman girl, whose purpose was some sort of NPC guiding the then main character Boopie the Jellyfish through an icy cavern. 
    Later her role was sort of expanded, being adopted by Howard the burglar early game boss character to act as a part of dual-boss battle. She got her icy scythe for the first time around 2019.
    In early 2019, I drew her in the future as an adult and started thinking about the "sequely" setting where she is the main protagonist. After that she stayed in this role, eventually becomming a human equivalent instead of a living snowman, and the "sequely" story becomming the only story.
