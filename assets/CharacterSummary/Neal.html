    <b>Neal</b> is a mid range Explorer participating in the Treasure Race. He uses electric magic and prefers to cast spells with finger guns. Neal is pretty unremarkable, outside of the plain mask he wears. Apparently, he is related to an infamous mercenary and needs to hide his face to avoid unnecessary confrontation, though he likes the "brand recognition" his mask gives him. Neal signed up for the Treasure Race because he thought it looked fun, not expecting to make it far in it.
