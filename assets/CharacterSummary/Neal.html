    <b>Neal Flynn Watt</b> is an Explorer from Adventurers' Guild in New East City. He uses electric magic that he prefers to cast with finger guns. Neal lives a largely average life, outside of the fact he apparently resembles a famous crimelord, causing a lot of conflict with law enforcement and local thugs. To overcome this, he started wearing a plain mask, which somehow helped for some reason. He signed up for the Treasure Run to support his friend Penelope who is also competing.
