    <b>Violet Penelope Kelvin</b> is an Explorer from Adventurers' Guild in New East City. She specialises in frost magic, which she primarily uses to manifest her Ice Scythe. Penelope grew up ambushing travellers in the roads and stealing to survive, something she resents now and avoids bringing up, mainly by avoiding talking with people in general. She signed up to compete in Treasure Run for reasons she is not sure of herself, though she is still determined to win.
