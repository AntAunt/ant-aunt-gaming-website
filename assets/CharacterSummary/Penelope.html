    <b>Penelope</b> is an Explorer participating in the Treasure Race. She is an ice magic user that wields a scythe conjured with a spell. Growing up she was extremely competitive and did whatever necessary to succeed, which never happened in a meaningful way. Penelope signed up to compete in the Treasure Race because deep down she wants to at least win at something, though she will avoid telling others that.
