    <b>Arbie Mole</b> is a junior Explorer who had been recently induced into the Adventurers' Guild in New East City. Her preferred magic element is plant, which manifests as spiny ivy tendrils. She is extremely anxious and avoids social encounters as much as possible. The main reason Arbie is participating in the Treasure Run is the Guild decided that would be a great way to gain more experience for her.
