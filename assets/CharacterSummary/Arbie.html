    <b>Arbie</b> is a junior Explorer participating in the Treasure Race. Her preferred magic element is nature, which manifests as spiny ivy tendrils she uses as whips. She is extremely anxious and avoids social encounters or combat as much as possible. She signed up for the Treasure Race to beef up her Explorer portfolio as she has trouble securing assignments.
