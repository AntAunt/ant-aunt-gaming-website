    <b>Scarlet</b> is an Explorer and a member of Crimson Thieves. She uses toxic magic and wields a custom made chemicals gun. Scarlet was dreaded for her imposing demeanor, leading to less opportunities in life. The Scarlet Thieves is the only group she came across who did not dismiss her as a scary troublemaker and invited her in. Her current main goal is to get a driver's license and get a cool motorcycle.
