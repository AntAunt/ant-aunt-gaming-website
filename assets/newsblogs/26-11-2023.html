<p>Hello!</p>
<p>AntAuntGaming here! Writing my first blog post on this website here. I've been working on this thing in my spare time trying to have a sort of gallery for my OC's(?), but I also for some reason spent a long time figuring out how to display external html's, so might as well use that here.</p>

<p>
    I've started this project trying to make a Discord bot for catching Pokémon, except instead of Pokémon it was legally distinct creatures I made when I was 10 years old. I slowly came to realisation that I have no idea what's the point of it was, as well as there's only one person who'd ever be interested in this (me heehee). Because of that I've figured I could make a website, learn one of those "angular" frameworks that are apparently in demand right now in the frontend software development sphere.

        Currently, I think I'm done with the Angular part of this, at least for now, so the main task for me now is adding content here. I thought it'd be cute to have this be a companion website to me struggling with making a platformer in the Godot game engine, so I would add characters and location and stuff info here as I am programming them into the game. I've currently added a page for Penelope, who is something of a main character, though I suppose you can see that her page is currently a little bit empty. I'm not really sure what to add in as I am terrible at writing or sharing ideas, and asking my target audience (just me again) isn't helping. Oh well.
